to create your local repository

use the linux commands cd and mkdir to create a folder where you want your repository to be

once you are in your folder e.g. mine is cd N:/test do the following command

$ git init

This will set up your local repository.

As I have already set up the git hub repository you will need to pull down the information stored there. YOU WILL NEED TO DO THIS EVERYTIME BEFORE YOU START WORK!!

To do this you need to create a variable called 'origin' to point to our github repository

To add origin do the following command

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/insegroupd/inse.git

Then to pull down the data do

$ git pull origin master

This will update your local repository with all the files from the git hub repository

Once file/s have been updated/edited/changed you will need to upload them back to github by doing the following 

$ git add * (for everytihng from the current directory including all sub directories

	  <file name> for a specific file name
	  <file path> for a directory

$ git commit -m 'changed file' adds a commit with the text in the string as a comment to 		your local repository 				

$ git push origin master
	it will ask for the username and password
	the files will now be pushed to the github repository
